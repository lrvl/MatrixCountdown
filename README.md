# Matrix-style Countdown Timer

This project is a visually appealing, Matrix-inspired countdown timer that can be customized to count down to any specific date. The countdown is displayed with a cool Matrix "digital rain" effect in the background.

## How to Use

The countdown timer is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be accessed using the following URL:

```
https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/
```

Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username and `your-repo-name` with the name of your repository.

### Setting a Custom Countdown Date

To set a custom countdown date, you need to add a query parameter to the URL. The parameter is `epoch`, and its value should be the Unix timestamp (in seconds) of your target date.

The URL format is as follows:

```
https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/?epoch=UNIX_TIMESTAMP
```

Replace `UNIX_TIMESTAMP` with the epoch time of your desired date.

### Examples

1. Countdown to New Year's Eve 2023 (December 31, 2023, 23:59:59 UTC):
   ```
   https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/?epoch=1704067199
   ```

2. Countdown to the next Solar Eclipse (April 8, 2024, 18:00:00 UTC):
   ```
   https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/?epoch=1712602800
   ```

3. Countdown to the 2024 Paris Olympics Opening Ceremony (July 26, 2024, 20:24:00 UTC):
   ```
   https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/?epoch=1722033840
   ```

### Getting the Epoch Timestamp

To get the epoch timestamp for your desired date:

1. Visit a Unix Timestamp converter website like [www.epochconverter.com](https://www.epochconverter.com/).
2. Enter your desired date and time.
3. Copy the resulting Unix timestamp.

## Default Date

If no `epoch` parameter is provided in the URL, the countdown will default to September 9, 2024.

## Customization

Feel free to fork this repository and customize the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript to change the appearance or behavior of the countdown timer. You can modify colors, fonts, or even the Matrix rain effect to suit your preferences.
